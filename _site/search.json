    "text": "Qualitative methods will be used to conduct three case studies analyzing the open data programs of three local governments. Research methods will include semi-structured interviews of open data stakeholders and analysis of open data policy and program documents to gather information from two sources about the intentions and actions taken to confirm that open data is being used by the public.\nOpen data stakeholders include: (a.) community-based organizations with a need for open data to support an initiative, (b.) civic technology groups, and (c.) technology companies who provide open data platforms and products."

    "text": "My interest in this topic was sparked by my work at Socrata/Tyler from 2015-2020 and current work with King County in Seattle, Washington. I have supported many open data initiatives and believe in the power of open data to provide valuable information to the public and others. However, I do worry about the future of open data programs if their value and use is not measured or known.\nThanks for your consideration to participate in my research!\n\n\n\nPhoto taken at Royal Roads University in 2022.\n\n\nPlease email me at alicia.9brown@royalroads.ca if you have questions or comments about this research."

Interview participants may select the method that best suits them. Interviews will be recorded and stored in a secure storage location without any personal information associated to the files. Virtual meeting tools may include Zoom or Teams using my Royal Roads student license, depending on the preference of the interview participant. The transcript and summary of your interview will be provided to you to confirm its accuracy and my understanding.\nInterview recordings will be processed to produce a transcript and prepare for my analysis. I will be using NVivo software to apply thematic codes to the interview. There will be no personal information included with the interview and resulting analysis within NVivo. The interview will not be processed or uploaded to any Artificial Intelligence (AI) tool.\nAll content produced from the interview and NVivo analysis will be assigned an anonymous identifier such as “Participant 1” and will be mapped in a separate file stored securely and apart from the interview files to protect your identity. The secure storage location requires multi-factor authentication where in addition to login credentials, a physical device that generates an additional secure code is required to successfully login to access the research files.\nInterview recordings, transcripts, and participant information will be destroyed upon completion of the research. As such, there are no anticipated risks to loss or unintended use of the information you share in an interview."

Measurements of open data utilization may help rationalize investment in open data programs by governments by showing evidence of public use as well as identify which open data initiatives and products are most popular with public users."
