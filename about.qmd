My interest in this topic was sparked by my [work](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aliciabrown) at Socrata/Tyler from 2015-2020 and current work with King County in Seattle, Washington. I have supported many open data initiatives and believe in the power of open data to provide valuable information to the public and others. However, I do worry about the future of open data programs if their value and use is not measured or known.
